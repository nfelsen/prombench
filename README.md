# prombench
Benchmark and integration testing tool for Prometheus 2.x

Prombench generates load with synthetic exporters and then queries Prometheus
to compare what we think we sent with what we hope was stored.

The eventual goal is to have Prombench monitor Prometheus internal metrics and
increase the load until Prometheus can't keep up, then throttle back until it's
just below the tipping point.  For now it just generates a static load.

# Usage

If the prometheus binary is in your PATH, you can run it without any arguments.
It won't run if the test dir ("prombench" by default) already exists, so either
remove it yourself between invocations or use the `-rmtestdir` option.

Each exporter generates 200 metrics with 100 labels, or 20000 real metrics.  I
can run about 30 such exporters on my system (8GB RAM, AMD FX(tm)-6300) at 1s
scrape interval for a total load of 300K samples/second.  Going above 300K
samples/second requires more RAM and will probably require tuning Prometheus,
see the tips in the [storage](https://prometheus.io/docs/operating/storage/)
part of the docs.  You can override the default Prometheus command ("prometheus")
with a path and command-line arguments at the end of the prombench command line, after --,
e.g.

    prombench -exporters inc:20 -- ~/src/prometheus/prometheus

Do not provide the -storage.local.retention Prometheus argument, use rather the
prombench -test-duration argument.  This allows the verification query to be scaled
to how much data should still be present by the time it's run.

# Exporters

The `-exporters` flag is a comma-separated list specifying which load exporters
to use and how many, e.g. inc:2,static:3 would launch 2 inc exporters and 3
static exporters.

The `inc` exporter increments the value of each metric on each scrape.

The `static` exporter exports unchanging metrics.

The `randcyclic` exporter exports semi-random values.

The `oscillate` exporter toggles between two sets of values on each cycle.
Unlike the others it doesn't actually go through the standard Prometheus client
library except during initialization, so it has much lower CPU needs.

# Scheduled tasks

The `-run-every` flag is a comma-separated list of commands to invoke at fixed
intervals.  For example, if you've installed [go-torch](https://github.com/uber/go-torch)
and have setup your path appropriately, you might run

    prombench -run-every '60s:go-torch -u http://localhost:9090 -f torch`date "+%s"`.svg'

to create per-minute flamegraphs based on debug/pprof data.

# Dashboards

I've put up a [rudimentary dashboard](https://grafana.net/dashboards/445) at
Grafana.net which is helpful for seeing what's going on under the hood.
